      <h2>2. Testing Document</h2>
      <p>
        To test the website we used live testing.
      </p>
      <p>
          Here are the questions we asked the testers:
      </p>
          <ol>
              <li>When is the next concert?</li>
              <li>What does the band's studio look like?</li>
              <li>Can you find their Facebook page?</li>
              <li>Can you leave a message for the band?</li>
              <li>What is the name of their first album?</li>
              <li>Are there any information that you think are missing from the website?</li>
          </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Tester Audience</h2>
      <p>
        When testing our website we wanted people in the our target group to test it.
        The band’s intended audience and target group is young adults in the age group 18 to 30 years old.
        In total we had five different people testing the website. Three of them were studying computer
        science, and we think that they will probably be more critical to the website and the technology we
        used compared to other people in our target group.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Testing Platforms</h2>
      <p>
        We wanted our testers to test the website on a wide variety of devices and browsers, to ensure
        good results. We have tested the website on Macbook, iPad, Samsung tablet, PC, iPhone and Android phone.
        The browsers used for the testing are Google Chrome, Safari, Samsung internet and Firefox.
        Support for Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer was not planned, and as such was not tested.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Feedback Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Generally we have gotten positive feedback on our website from the testers. They think the design is really nice.
        To make it easy we have written some of the responses on the questions we asked here.
      </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>When is the next concert?</strong>
            <p>All testers thought this was easy and found the next concert on their first attempt.</p></li>
            <li><strong>What does the band’s studio look like?</strong>
            <p>This one was a little harder. Two of the testers first tried the page called “About Excellence”,
            but could not found it here. When it was not here their next attempt as the picture page under media.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Can you find their Facebook page?</strong>
            <p>To find their Facebook page the testers didn’t use the footer, instead they went to contact and
            “Contact Us”.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Can you leave a message for the band?</strong>
            <p>The testers immediately found the guestbook where they can leave a message.</p></li>
            <li><strong>What is the name of their first album?</strong>
            <p>This one also was a little trickier because some of the testers didn’t know what a discography is.
            First they tried to found Excellence first album under “About Excellence”, and when they couldn’t find
            it here they just searched around on the web page and found it under “Discography” by an accident.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Are there any information that you think are missing from the website?</strong>
            <p>One of the testers missed information that explicitly tells that Excellence is a band. One of the other testers asks
            for a link in the faq to the guestbook, so that if the question they are searching for is not in the faq they know
            a place to ask.   </p></li>
        </ol>

      <h2>6. Your Response</h2>
      <p>
        From the testing we saw that some thought it was difficult to find the picture of the studio and the
        discography. To solve the problem about the studio picture maybe we should have this picture under
        “About Excellence” instead of having it with the other pictures from the concerts. In addition we should
        also make it easier for people to find the discography. Maybe we should rename the section
        from “Discography” to “Music” or “Albums” to make it more user friendly for people who is not that
        familiar with music terminology.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can also implement the functions that our testers were missing. Maybe we can add some more text on the
        home page so that it is clearer that this is a website for a band when you are entering. Now it's mostly
        the picture and the text "We play music" that give this information, but we add a few sentences about
        the band here it will be even clearer. We can also implement the link in the faq to the guestbook to make the website
        even more user friendly.
      </p>
      <p>All these small changes and are quick and easy to implement.</p>

      <h2>7. Self Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        First of all this project has been very good for learning. Not only the have we learned HTML, CSS and
        JavaScript, but we have also learned about project work and organizing. It is really cool that we got
        the opportunity to try out something that feels like a real project. Even though we did not have a
        real client the project felt realistic because we had to write the requirements and plan the design
        before starting to actually program the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have learned a lot about programming group projects, how to organize our work, and how messy it gets.
         We found that Git and GitHub were excellent tools, but they were difficult to start out with, but in
         the end very rewarding. The most challenging part of the project was combine it into a single project.
         In the beginning everyone was working on their own documents and code, and a lot of complications arose
         when we combined our work. At this point it was very helpful to have a good plan and lots of meetings,
         and we got it working with enough work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Something we have learned from this project that we will do different the next time is to use a task
        manager. This time we only used the table we made in the design document for task management, but this
        was not dynamic. A task manager will make it easier to see how far we have gotten with the project
        and which tasks that are remaining.
      </p>
